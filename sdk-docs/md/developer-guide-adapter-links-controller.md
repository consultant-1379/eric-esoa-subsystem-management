| Response Code | Description | Response Data Structure|
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|**200 - OK**| Information about adapter link was read successfully.| See Below|
|**400 - Bad Request**|If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect, for example, if the request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the payload body contains a syntactically incorrect data structure, the API producer responds with this response code. If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource would be so big that the performance of the API producer is adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for the affected resource, it responds with this response code. If there is an application error related to the client's input that cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all error"), the API producer responds with this response code.|[Error Response Data Structure](#adapter-links-error-data-structure)|
|**401 - Unauthorized**| If the request does not contain an access token even though it is required, or if the request contains an authorization token that is invalid; for example: expired or revoked, the API producer should respond with this response. The details of the error is returned in the **WWW-Authenticate** HTTP  header, which is defined in [IETF RFC6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) and [IETF RFC 7235](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7235). The ErrorMessage structure may be provided.|[Error Response Data Structure](#adapter-links-error-data-structure)|
|**403 - Forbidden**| If the API consumer is not allowed to complete a particular request to a particular resource, the API producer responds with this response code. The ``ErrorMessage`` structure will be provided. In the ``detail`` attribute, information about the source of the problem is included. The detail attribute may also include information about how to solve the problem.|[Error Response Data Structure](#adapter-links-error-data-structure)|
|**404 - Not Found**|If the API producer did not find a current representation for the resource addressed by the URI passed in the request, or it is not willing to disclose that one exists, it responds with this response code. The ``ErrorMessage`` structure may be provided. The ``detail`` attribute includes information about the source of the problem, for example, an incorrect resource URI variable.|[Error Response Data Structure](#adapter-links-error-data-structure)|
|**500 - Internal Server Error**|If there is an application error not related to the client's input that cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all error"), the API producer responds with this response code. The ``ErrorMessage`` structure will be provided, and will include in the ``detail`` attribute more information about the source of the problem.|[Error Response Data Structure](#adapter-links-error-data-structure)|
|**503 - Service Unavailable**|If the API producer encounters an internal overload situation of itself or of a system it relies on, it responds with this response code, from the provisions in [IETF RFC 7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231), a **"Retry-After"** HTTP header or an alternative to refuse the connection will be returned. The ``ErrorMessage`` structure may be omitted.|[Error Response Data Structure](#adapter-links-error-data-structure)|
