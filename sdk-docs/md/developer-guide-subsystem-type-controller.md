## Read Subsystem Types

Subsystem Type Service manages the types of subsystems EO-SO can connect and
interwork with.
Each subsystem type is identified by an unique identifier and a descriptive type
string.
The list of connected subsystem types can be retrieved by means of SO REST i/f
as herein outlined.
This API is used to retrieves subsystem types. Category can be specified to obtain
primary, or custom types only.

**Path:** GET /subsystem-manager/v1/subsystem-types

**Query Parameters:**

- ``category`` (optional) |Allows the user to get subsystem types based on category.

**Request header:** Content-Type: application/json

**Responses:** This API call produces media type according to the
``Accept`` request header. The media type will be conveyed by the
Content-Type response header: ``application/json``

| Response Code | Description | Response Data Structure|
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|**200 - OK**| Information about subsystem types was read successfully.| See Below|
|**401 - Unauthorized**| If the request does not contain|
|**403 - Forbidden**| If the API consumer is not allowed to complete a particular request to a particular resource, the API producer responds with this response code. The ``ErrorMessage`` structure will be provided. In the ``detail`` attribute, information about the source of the problem is included. The detail attribute may also include information about how to solve the problem.|[Error Response Data Structure](#subsystem-type-error-data-structure)|
|**503 - Service Unavailable**|If the API producer encounters an internal overload situation of itself or of a system it relies on, it responds with this response code, from the provisions in [IETF RFC 7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231), a **"Retry-After"** HTTP header or an alternative to refuse the connection will be returned. The ``ErrorMessage`` structure may be omitted.|[Error Response Data Structure](#subsystem-type-error-data-structure)|
