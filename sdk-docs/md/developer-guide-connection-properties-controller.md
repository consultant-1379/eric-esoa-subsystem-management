## Get List Of Connection Properties

This API allows to get the list of all the connection properties for a given
subsystem identifier.

**Path:** GET /subsystem-manager/v1/subsystems/{subsystemId}/connection-properties

**Path - Parameters:**

- ``subsystemId`` (required) â€” The subsystem id

**Request header:** Content-Type: application/json

**Responses:** This API call produces media type according to the
``Accept`` request header. The media type will be conveyed by the
Content-Type response header: ``application/json``

| Response Code | Description | Response Data Structure|
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|**200 - OK**| Information about connection properties was read successfully..| See Below|
|**400 - Bad Request**|If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect, for example, if the request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the payload body contains a syntactically incorrect data structure, the API producer responds with this response code. If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource would be so big that the performance of the API producer is adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for the affected resource, it responds with this response code. If there is an application error related to the client's input that cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all error"), the API producer responds with this response code.|[Error Response Data Structure](#connection-properties-error-data-structure)|
|**401 - Unauthorized**| If the request does not contain an access token even though it is required, or if the request contains an authorization token that is invalid; for example: expired or revoked, the API producer should respond with this response. The details of the error is returned in the **WWW-Authenticate** HTTP  header, which is defined in [IETF RFC6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) and [IETF RFC 7235](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7235). The ErrorMessage structure may be provided.|[Error Response Data Structure](#connection-properties-error-data-structure)|
|**403 - Forbidden**| If the API consumer is not allowed to complete a particular request to a particular resource, the API producer responds with this response code. The ``ErrorMessage`` structure will be provided. In the ``detail`` attribute, information about the source of the problem is included. The detail attribute may also include information about how to solve the problem.|[Error Response Data Structure](#connection-properties-error-data-structure)|
|**404 - Not Found**|If the API producer did not find a current representation for the resource addressed by the URI passed in the request, or it is not willing to disclose that one exists, it responds with this response code. The ``ErrorMessage`` structure may be provided. The ``detail`` attribute includes information about the source of the problem, for example, an incorrect resource URI variable.|[Error Response Data Structure](#connection-properties-error-data-structure)|
|**500 - Internal Server Error**|If there is an application error not related to the client's input that cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all error"), the API producer responds with this response code.
