        The request was accepted for processing, but the  processing has not been completed. The response body shall be empty. The HTTP response

        If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the payload body
        contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API producer shall respond with this response code. --- If the response to a GET
        request which queries a container resource would be so big that the performance of the API producer is adversely affected, and the API
        producer does not support paging for the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. --- If there is an application error
        related to the client's input that cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all error"), the API producer shall respond
        with this response code.

        If the request contains no access token even though one is required, or if the request contains an authorization token that is invalid (e.g.
        expired or revoked), the API producer should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be returned in the WWW-Authenticate
        HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC 6750 and IETF RFC 7235. The ErrorMessage structure may be provided.

        If the API consumer is not allowed to perform a particular request to a particular resource, the API producer shall respond with this

        the problem, and may indicate how to solve it.

        Internal Server Error
        If there is an application error not related to the client's input that cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
        error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The "ErrorMessage" structure shall be provided, and shall include in the
        "detail" attribute more information about the source of the problem.

        If the API producer did not find a current representation for the resource addressed by the URI passed in the request, or is not willing to
        disclose that one exists, it shall respond with this response code. The "ErrorMessage" structure may be provided, including in the "detail"
        attribute information about the source of the problem, e.g. a wrong resource URI variable.

        Service Unavailable
        If the API producer encounters an internal overload situation of itself or of a system it relies on, it should respond with this response
        code, following the provisions in IETF RFC 7231 [13] for the use of the "Retry-After" HTTP header and for the alternative to refuse the
        connection. The "ErrorMessage" structure may be omitted.
