  title: Subsystem Management Service
  description: |
    The Subsystem Management service allows Users to create and configure connected systems. Connected systems are the external systems which EO-SO
    will interact with during the life-cycle of a network service. EO-SO requires an NFVO and a Domain Manager / EMS system for the life-cycle
    management of network services.

    An instance of a connected system cannot be deleted if is currently in use by an active service.
    The service must be deleted prior to deleting the connected system.

    EO-SO supports:
      * Multiple instances of Domain Manager / EMS - unlimited per vendor
      * One instance of NFVO / Cloud Manager
      * One instance of Inventory System / EAI
      * Multiple instance of CM Gateway and Physical Device â€“ unlimited per vendor
      * Multiple instance of Authentication Systems with subtype of Oauth2 Client Credentials
      * No limits applied to custom Subsystem Type the end-user adds to
